**Abstract**

The integration of **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT)** in hydroponics and aquaponics offers a revolutionary approach to modern farming. This project presents a **smart, AI-driven hydroponics and aquaponics system** that leverages **real-time sensor monitoring, automation, and predictive analytics** to enhance efficiency, optimize resource utilization, and improve crop and fish health. Using **TensorFlow AI models**, the system can predict **pH fluctuations, nutrient levels, water temperature, dissolved oxygen levels, and plant/fish health**, ensuring precise and timely adjustments. The integration of **IoT sensors, cloud computing, and machine learning algorithms** allows farmers to **remotely monitor and control** their farms through a **mobile app and web dashboard**. This solution aims to significantly reduce **water and nutrient wastage** while increasing **crop yield and fish growth efficiency**.

The core components of this system include **IoT sensors (pH, EC, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and water level sensors), AI-driven automation (TensorFlow-based predictions for nutrient and water management), and cloud-based data analytics**. The system is capable of **real-time monitoring, automated pH and nutrient dosing, smart aeration, and AI-powered plant disease detection**. Furthermore, it employs **Computer Vision techniques** for identifying **plant deficiencies and fish behavior anomalies**. The proposed solution can be implemented in **small-scale farms, urban hydroponic gardens, and commercial aquaponic facilities**, making **sustainable farming more accessible and efficient**. By combining **AI, IoT, and automation**, this project provides an **intelligent, scalable, and resource-efficient** alternative to traditional farming practices, ensuring **higher productivity with minimal manual intervention**.
